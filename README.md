# clj-generativeartistry

[Generativeartistry tutorials](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/) implemented in Clojure/Processing
using [Quil](http://quil.info/).

I mostly followed the logic of original implementation, deliberately replacing imperative techniques with their functional equivalents.

## Usage

REPL - run `(require 'generativeartistry.<sketch>)`.

Emacs - run cider, open the sketch and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.
